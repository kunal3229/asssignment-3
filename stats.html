            &nbsp;&nbsp; Basketball has become a popular sport in India. Almost every college, university and school has itâ€™s own basketball team. The youth has become really passionate about the game and it is also being considered as a profession by many young souls. Even though India accepted this game quite later, the progress it has been making is commendable. Being one of the earliest countries to adopt basketball, India has so far produced numerous talented basketball players, who have earned recognition in the international arena. Basketball in India is mainly being run and managed by a large number of national and state level associations, spread all over India. These basketball associations are working with a common view of popularizing the game to other parts of the nation. Apart from that, developing the overall infrastructure for the game and upcoming talents is the main objective of these associations. <br>
